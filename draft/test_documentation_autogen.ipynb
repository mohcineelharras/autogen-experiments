Gonzalez\\nUC Berkeley\\nhttps://memgpt.ai\\nABSTRACT\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by\\nlimited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversa-\\ntions and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context win-\\ndows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration\\nfrom hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide\\nthe appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast\\nand slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT),\\na system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively\\nprovide extended context within the LLM’s limited context window, and utilizes\\ninterrupts to manage control flow between itself and the user. We evaluate our\\nOS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern\\nLLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT\\nis able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM’s con-\\ntext window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational\\nagents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interac-\\ntions with their users. We release MemGPT code and data for our experiments at\\nhttps://memgpt.ai.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) and their underlying transformer architec-\\nture (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) have become\\nthe cornerstone of conversational AI and have led to a wide array of consumer and enterprise applica-\\ntions. Despite these advances, the limited fixed-length context windows used by LLMs significantly\\nhinders their applicability to long conversations or reasoning about long documents. For example,\\nthe most widely used open-source LLMs can only support a few dozen back-and-forth messages or\\nreason about a short document before exceeding their maximum input length (Touvron et al., 2023).\\nNaively extending the context length of transformers incurs a quadratic increase in computational\\ntime and memory cost due to the transformer architecture’s self-attention mechanism, making the\\ndesign of new long-context architectures a pressing research challenge (Dai et al., 2019; Kitaev\\net al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020). While developing longer models is an active area of research\\n(Dong et al., 2023), even if we could overcome the computational challenges of context scaling,\\nrecent research shows that long-context models struggle to utilize additional context effectively (Liu\\net al., 2023a). As consequence, given the considerable resources needed to train state-of-the-art\\nLLMs and apparent diminishing returns of context scaling, there is a critical need for alternative\\ntechniques to support long context.\\nIn this paper, we study how to provide the illusion of an infinite context while continuing to use\\nfixed-context models. Our approach borrows from the idea of virtual memory paging that was\\ndeveloped to enable applications to work on datasets that far exceed the available memory. We\\nleverage the recent progress in function calling abilities of LLM agents (Schick et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\\n2023b) to design MemGPT, an OS-inspired LLM system for virtual context management . We\\ndraw inspiration from traditional OSes’ hierarchical memory management to effectively “page” in\\n1arXiv:2310.08560v1  [cs.AI]  12 Oct 2023Preprint\\nLLM processorParserVirtual contextExternal context∞ tokensMain contextMax token limitYieldEventMessage🧑Document upload📄System message🔔FunctionRead memorySend message📣…ParserTimer⏱…Pause interrupts🔕Write memory\\nFigure 1: In MemGPT (components shaded), a fixed-context LLM is augmented with a hierarchical\\nmemory system and functions that let it manage its own memory. The LLM processor takes main\\ncontext (analogous to OS main memory/RAM) as input, and outputs text interpreted by a parser,\\nresulting either in a yield or a function call. MemGPT uses functions to move data between main\\ncontext and external context (analogous to OS disk memory). When the processor generates a\\nfunction call, it can request control ahead of time to chain together functions. When yielding, the\\nprocessor is paused until the next external event (e.g., a user message or scheduled interrupt).\\nand out information between context windows (analogous to “main memory” in operating systems)\\nand external storage. MemGPT manages the control flow between the memory management, the\\nLLM processing module, and user. This design allows for repeated context modifications during a\\nsingle task, allowing the agent to more effectively utilize its limited context.\\nIn MemGPT, we treat context windows as a constrained memory resource, and design a memory\\nhiearchy for LLMs analogous to memory tiers used in traditional OSes (Patterson et al., 1988).\\nApplications in traditional OSes interact with virtual memory , which provides an illusion of there\\nbeing more memory resources than are actually available in physical (i.e., main) memory by the OS\\npaging overflow data to disk and retrieving data (via a page fault) back into memory when accessed\\nby applications. To provide a similar illusion of longer context length (analogous to virtual memory),\\nwe allow the LLM to manage what is placed in its own context (analogous to physical memory) via\\nan ‘LLM OS’, which we call MemGPT. MemGPT enables the LLM to retrieve relevant historical\\ndata missing from what is placed in-context, similar to an OS page fault. Additionally, the agent can\\niteratively modify what is in context for a single task, in the same way a process may access virtual\\nmemory repeatedly. Figure 1 illustrates the components of MemGPT.\\nThe combined use of a memory-hierarchy, OS functions and event-based control flow allow\\nMemGPT to handle unbounded context using LLMs that have finite context windows. To demon-\\nstrate the utility of our new OS-inspired LLM system, we evaluate MemGPT on two domains where\\nthe performance of existing LLMs is severely limited by finite context: document analysis, where the\\nlength of standard text files can quickly exceed the input capacity of modern LLMs, and conversa-\\ntional agents, where LLMs bound by limited conversation windows lack context awareness, persona\\nconsistency, and long-term memory during extended conversations. In both settings, MemGPT is\\nable to overcome the limitations of finite context to outperform existing LLM-based approaches.\\n2 M EMORY -GPT (M EMGPT)\\nIn this section, we outline the implementation of MemGPT, an OS-inspired LLM system that teaches\\nLLMs to manage their own memory to achieve unbounded context. MemGPT’s multi-level mem-\\nory architecture delineates between two primary memory types: main context (analogous to main\\nmemory/physical memory/RAM) and external context (analogous to disk memory/disk storage).\\nMain context is the standard fixed-context window in modern language models—anything in main\\ncontext is considered in-context and can be accessed by the LLM processor during inference. Ex-\\nternal context refers to any information that is held outside of the LLMs fixed context window. This\\nout-of-context data must always be explicitly moved into main context in order for it to be passed to\\n2Preprint\\nTable 1: Comparing context lengths of commonly used models / APIs (data collected 9/2023).\\n*Assuming a preprompt of 1k tokens, and an average message size of ∼50 tokens ( ∼250 characters).\\nModel / API designation Availability Max Tokens Max conversation length*\\nllama-1 model family Open source 2k tokens 20 total messages\\nllama-2 model family Open source 4k tokens 60 total messages\\ngpt-3.5-turbo API 4k tokens 60 total messages\\ngpt-4 API 8k tokens 140 total messages\\ngpt-3.5-turbo-16k API 16k tokens 300 total messages\\ngpt-4-32k Limited API 32k tokens ∼600 total messages\\nclaude-instant-1 Limited API 100k tokens ∼2000 total messages\\nclaude-2 Limited API 100k tokens ∼2000 total messages\\nthe LLM processor during inference. MemGPT provides function calls that the LLM processor can\\nuse to manage its own memory without any user intervention.\\n2.1 M AIN CONTEXT\\nIn MemGPT we refer to the LLM inputs (that are bound by the maximum number of input tokens)\\nas the system’s main context. In LLM-based conversational agents, a significant portion of main\\ncontext tokens is generally used to hold a ‘system message’ or ‘preprompt’ that dictates the nature\\nof the interaction to the system, while the remainder of the tokens can be used to hold conversation\\ndata (Touvron et al., 2023; SillyTavern, 2023). This preprompt is the main way to enable the system\\nto adopt various distinct personas without requiring finetuning of the base model; depending on\\nthe use case, the preprompt can range from basic primers (e.g., ‘You are a helpful assistant.’) to\\ncomplex instructions comprising of thousands of tokens (e.g., a fictional character card that includes\\nthe character’s background and example dialogue). Beyond conversational agents, large preprompts\\nare also common when LLMs are used to solve complex tasks that require long instructions and/or\\ninstructions with many in-context examples (Liu et al., 2023b).\\nBecause of the importance of the preprompt in dictating system behavior, it is common for the pre-\\nprompt to consume more than a thousand tokens, which means the entire context window in many\\nmodern LLMs will be exhausted only with a few dozen back-and-forth messages between the user\\nand system. For example, a 1000 token preprompt (roughly the size of the MemGPT preprompt in\\nour experiments) leaves space for only about 60 remaining messages when using 4K context models\\nsuch as llama-2 orgpt-3.5-turbo (see Table 1 for more examples). In settings where the\\nuser is expected to communicate frequently with the system (for example, virtual companions or\\npersonalized assistants), it is easy to imagine exceeding the maximum conversation length even for\\nmodels with 100k context windows in a matter of days (or potentially hours). Resursive summariza-\\ntion (Wu et al., 2021b) is a simple way to address overflowing context windows, however, recursive\\nsummarization is inherently lossy and eventually leads to large holes in the memory of the system\\n(as we demonstrate in Section 3). This motivates the need for a more comprehensive way to manage\\nmemory for conversational systems that are meant to be used in long-term settings.\\nIn our experiments on multi-session chat and document analysis, we further divide main context\\ninto three components: system instructions , which hold the base LLM instructions (e.g., informa-\\ntion describing MemGPT functions and control flow to the LLM), conversational context , which\\nholds a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue of recent event history (e.g., messages between the agent and\\nuser), and working context , which serves as a working memory scratchpad for the agent. System\\ninstructions are read-only and pinned to main context (they do not change during the lifetime of the\\nMemGPT agent), conversational context is read-only with a special eviction policy (if the queue\\nreaches a certain size, a portion of the front is truncated or compressed via recursive summariza-\\ntion), and working context is writeable by the LLM processor via function calls. Combined, the\\nthree parts of main context cannot exceed the underlying LLM processors’s maximum context size,\\nand in practice we limit the size of conversational context and working context to a fixed constant\\ndetermined by the processor’s context window and the system instructions length.\\n3Preprint\\nHello Chad, welcome!

Let’s make today’s chat another cherished\\nmemory for you!MemGPT\\nFigure 2: An example conversation snippet where MemGPT writes details from conversation to\\nworking context without a memory warning from the system.\\n2.2 E XTERNAL CONTEXT\\nExternal context refers to out-of-context storage that lies outside the context window of the LLM\\nprocessor, analogous to disk memory (i.e. disk storage) in OSes. Information in external context is\\nnot immediately visible to the LLM processor, however, it can be brought into main context through\\nappropriate function calls. In practice, the underlying storage in external context can take various\\nforms which can be configured for specific tasks: for example, for conversational agents it may be\\ndesireable to store full chat logs between the user and agent (that MemGPT can access at a later\\ndate), and for document analysis large document collections can be stored inside external context\\nthat MemGPT can bring into restricted main context via paginated function calls to disk.\\nIn our experiments, using MemGPT for multi-session chat and document analysis, we use databases\\nto store text documents and embeddings/vectors, provide several ways for the LLM processor to\\nquery external context: timestamp-based search, text-based search, and embedding-based search.\\nWe make a distinction between two types of external context: recall storage , which stores the entire\\nhistory of events processed by the LLM processor (in essense the full uncompressed queue from\\nactive memory), and archival storage , which serves as a general read-write datastore that the agent\\ncan utilize as overflow for the in-context read-write core memory. In the context of conversational\\nagents, archival storage allows MemGPT to store facts, experiences, preferences, etc. about the\\nagent or user beyond the strict token limit of main context, and search over recall storage allows\\nthe MemGPT to find past interactions related to a particular query or within a specific time period.\\nIn the context of document analysis, archival storage can be used to search over (and add to) an\\nexpansive document database.\\n2.3 S ELF-DIRECTED EDITING AND RETRIEVAL\\nMemGPT orchestrates data movement between main context and external context via function calls\\nthat are generated by the LLM processor. Memory edits and retrieval are entirely self-directed:\\nMemGPT autonomously updates and searches through its own memory based on the current con-\\ntext. For instance, it can decide when to move items between contexts (Figure 2) and modify its\\nmain context to better reflect its evolving understanding of its current objectives and responsibilities\\n(Figure 4). We implement self-directed editing and retrieval by providing explicit instructions within\\nthe preprompt that guide the system on how to interact with its memory systems. These instructions\\ncomprise two main components: (1) a detailed description of the memory hierarchy and their re-\\nspective utilities, and (2) a function schema (complete with their natural language descriptions) that\\nthe system can call to access or modify its memory.\\n4Preprint\\nHello Chad!

This output string is parsed by MemGPT to ensure correctness,\\nand if the parser validates the function arguments the function is executed. The results, including\\nany runtime errors that occur (e.g. trying to add to main context when it is already at maximum\\ncapacity), are then fed back to the processor by MemGPT. This feedback loop enables the system\\nto learn from its actions and adjust its behavior accordingly. Awareness of context limits is a key\\naspect in making the self-editing mechanism work effectively, to this end MemGPT prompts the\\nprocessor with warnings regarding token limitations to guide its memory management decisions\\n(Figure 3). Additionally, our memory retrieval mechanisms are designed to be cognizant of these\\ntoken constraints and implement pagination to prevent retrieval calls from overflowing the context',\n",
       "  'window.\\n2.4 C ONTROL FLOW AND FUNCTION CHAINING\\nIn MemGPT, events trigger LLM inference: events are generalized inputs to MemGPT and can con-\\nsist of user messages (in chat applications), system messages (e.g. main context capacity warnings),\\nuser interactions (e.g. an alert that a user just logged in, or an alert that they finished uploading\\na document), and timed events that are run on a regular schedule (allowing MemGPT to run ‘un-\\nprompted’ without user intervention). MemGPT processes events with a parser to convert them into\\nplain text messages that can be appended to main context and eventually be fed as input into the\\nLLM processor.\\nMany practical tasks require calling multiple functions in sequence, for example, navigating through\\nmultiple pages of results from a single query or collating data from different documents in main\\ncontext from separate queries. Function chaining allows MemGPT to execute multiple function\\ncalls sequentially before returning control to the user. In MemGPT, functions can be called with\\na special flag that requests control be immediately returned to the processor after the requested\\nfunction completes execution. If this flag is present, MemGPT will add the function output to\\nmain context and (as opposed to pausing processor execution). If this flag is not present (a yield ),\\nMemGPT will not run the LLM processor until the next external event trigger (e.g. a user message\\nor scheduled interrupt).\\n5Preprint\\nWelcome back!

(2021) and\\nintroduce two new dialogue tasks that evaluate an agent’s ability to retain knowledge across long\\nconversations. For document analysis, we benchmark MemGPT on existing tasks from Liu et al.\\n(2023a) for question answering and key-value retrieval over lengthy documents. We also propose\\na new nested key-value retrieval task requiring collating information across multiple data sources,\\nwhich tests the ability of an agent to collate information from multiple data sources (multi-hop\\nretrieval). We publicly release our augmented MSC dataset, nested KV retrieval dataset, and a\\ndataset of embeddings for 20M Wikipedia articles to facilitate future research. Our code for the full\\nconversational and document analysis benchmarks is available at https://memgpt.ai.\\n3.1 M EMGPT FOR CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS\\nConversational agents like virtual companions and personalized assistants aim to engage users in\\nnatural, long-term interactions, potentially spanning weeks, months, or even years. This creates\\nchallenges for models with fixed-length contexts, which can only reference a limited history of the\\nconversation. An ‘infinite context’ agent should seamlessly handle continuous exchanges without\\nboundary or reset. When conversing with a user, such an agent must satisfy two key criteria:\\n• Consistency - The agent should maintain conversational coherence. New facts, preferences,\\nand events mentioned should align with prior statements from both the user and agent.\\n• Engagement - The agent should draw on long-term knowledge about the user to personalize\\nresponses. Referencing prior conversations makes dialogue more natural and engaging.\\nWe therefore assess our proposed model, MemGPT, on these two criteria:\\n• Does MemGPT leverage its memory to improve conversation consistency? Can it remem-\\nber relevant facts, preferences, and events from past interactions to maintain coherence?\\n• Does MemGPT produce more engaging dialogue by taking advantage of memory? Does it\\nspontaneously incorporate long-range user information to personalize messages?\\nBy evaluating on consistency and engagement, we can determine how well MemGPT handles the\\nchallenges of long-term conversational interaction compared to fixed-context baselines. Its ability\\nto satisfy these criteria will demonstrate whether unbounded context provides meaningful benefits\\nfor conversational agents.\\n6Preprint\\nTaylor Swift!Hey, remember that time we talked about music?

(2021), which contains multi-session chat logs generated by human labelers,\\neach of whom was asked to play a consistent persona for the duration of all sessions. Each multi-\\nsession chat in MSC has five total sessions, and each session consists of a roughly a dozen messages.\\nAs part of our consistency experiments, we created a new session (session 6) that contains a single\\nquestion-answer response pair between the same two personas.\\n3.1.2 D EEP MEMORY RETRIEVAL TASK (CONSISTENCY )\\nWe introduce a new ‘deep memory retrieval’ (DMR) task based on the MSC dataset designed to test\\nthe consistency of a conversational agent. In DMR, the conversational agent is asked a question by\\nthe user that explicitly refers back to a prior conversation and has a very narrow expected answer\\nrange (see Figure 5 for an example). We generated the DMR question-answer (QA) pairs using\\na separate LLM that was instructed to write a question from one user to another that could only\\nbe answered correctly using knowledge gained from the past sessions (see Appendix for further\\ndetails).\\nWe evaluate the quality of the generated response against the ‘gold response’ using ROUGE-L scores\\n(Lin, 2004) and an ‘LLM judge’, which is instructed to evaluate whether or not the generated re-\\nsponse is consistent with the gold response (GPT-4 has been shown to have high agreement with\\nhuman evaluators (Zheng et al., 2023)). In practice, we notice that the generated responses (from\\nboth MemGPT and the baselines) were generally more verbose than the gold responses; ROUGE-\\nL (which measures the longest common subsequence between the generated and reference text) is\\nrobust to this semantic variation in correct responses since it evaluates the presence of words from\\nthe gold answer in the generated answer. We also report the precision and recall scores used in\\ncalclating the ROUGE-L (F1) score.\\nMemGPT utilizes memory to maintain coherence: Table 2 shows the performance of MemGPT\\nvs the fixed-memory baselines. We compare against three variations of fixed-context baselines: an\\nagent that see a recursive summary of the past five conversations (summary 1:5), an agent that can\\n7Preprint\\nTable 2: Deep memory retrieval (DMR) performance.

To evaluate the ‘engagingness’ of a\\nconversation opener using the MSC dataset, we compare the generated opener to the gold personas:\\nan engaging conversation opener should draw from one (or several) of the data points contained\\nin the persona, which in MSC effectively summarize the knowledge accumulated throughout all\\nprior sessions (see Figure 6 for an example). We also compare to the human-generated gold opener,\\ni.e., the first response in the following session. Because the quality of conversation openers is not\\nnecessarily constrained by context length (a recursive summary or even a few snippets from prior\\nconversations is enough to craft an opener that uses prior knowledge), we use this task to ablate\\nMemGPT’s different components (rather than compare it to fixed-context baselines).\\nWe report the CSIM scores of MemGPT’s openers in Table 3. We test several variations of\\nMemGPT: MemGPT without working context (storing persona information) and recall storage (stor-\\ning conversation information), MemGPT without working context or without recall storage, and\\nMemGPT with both working context and recall storage enabled.\\nMemGPT utilizes memory to increase engagement: As seen in Table 3 and Figure 6, MemGPT\\nis able to craft engaging openers that perform similarly to and occasionally exceed the hand-written\\nhuman openers. We observe that MemGPT tends to craft openers that are both more verbose and\\ncover more aspects of the persona information than the human baseline. Additionally, we can see\\nthe storing information in working context is key to generating engaging openers. Without working\\ncontext, MemGPT ’s openers significantly degrade in quality; having the dialogue stored in recall\\n8Preprint\\nTable 3: Conversation opener performance (session 5).

For example, OpenAI’s (closed) GPT models behind their popular ChatGPT consumer\\nchatbot application have a limit of 32k input tokens, and the state-of-the-art open source Llama 2\\nmodels have a limit of only 4k tokens (see Table 1). Anthropic have released (closed) models han-\\ndling up to 100k tokens, but many documents easily surpass that length; Stephen King’s bestselling\\nnovel The Shining contains around 150k words, which equates to roughly 200k tokens (words-to-\\ntoken varies based on the specific tokenizer used), and legal or financial documents such as Annual\\nReports (SEC Form 10-K) can easily pass the million token mark. Moreover, many real document\\nanalysis tasks require drawing connections across multiple such lengthy documents. Anticipating\\nthese scenarios, it becomes difficult to envision blindly scaling up context as a solution to the fixed-\\ncontext problem. Recent research (Liu et al., 2023a) also raises doubts about the utility of simply\\nscaling contexts, since they find uneven attention distributions in large context models (the model is\\nmore capable of recalling information at the beginning or end of its context window, vs tokens in the\\nmiddle). To enable reasoning across documents, more flexible memory architectures such as those\\nused in MemGPT are likely needed.\\n9Preprint\\n 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\\n 0 100  200  300  400  500  600  700Accuracy\\nDocuments retrievedGPT-3.5\\nGPT-4\\nMemGPT\\n 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\\n 0  1  2  3  4Accuracy\\nNesting levelsGPT-3.5\\nGPT-4\\nMemGPT\\nFigure 7: Document QA and nested KV retrieval task performance.

Gonzalez\\nUC Berkeley\\nhttps://memgpt.ai\\nABSTRACT\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by\\nlimited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversa-\\ntions and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context win-\\ndows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration\\nfrom hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide\\nthe appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast\\nand slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT),\\na system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively\\nprovide extended context within the LLM’s limited context window, and utilizes\\ninterrupts to manage control flow between itself and the user. We evaluate our\\nOS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern\\nLLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT\\nis able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM’s con-\\ntext window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational\\nagents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interac-\\ntions with their users. We release MemGPT code and data for our experiments at\\nhttps://memgpt.ai.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) and their underlying transformer architec-\\nture (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) have become\\nthe cornerstone of conversational AI and have led to a wide array of consumer and enterprise applica-\\ntions. Despite these advances, the limited fixed-length context windows used by LLMs significantly\\nhinders their applicability to long conversations or reasoning about long documents. For example,\\nthe most widely used open-source LLMs can only support a few dozen back-and-forth messages or\\nreason about a short document before exceeding their maximum input length (Touvron et al., 2023).\\nNaively extending the context length of transformers incurs a quadratic increase in computational\\ntime and memory cost due to the transformer architecture’s self-attention mechanism, making the\\ndesign of new long-context architectures a pressing research challenge (Dai et al., 2019; Kitaev\\net al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020). While developing longer models is an active area of research\\n(Dong et al., 2023), even if we could overcome the computational challenges of context scaling,\\nrecent research shows that long-context models struggle to utilize additional context effectively (Liu\\net al., 2023a). As consequence, given the considerable resources needed to train state-of-the-art\\nLLMs and apparent diminishing returns of context scaling, there is a critical need for alternative\\ntechniques to support long context.\\nIn this paper, we study how to provide the illusion of an infinite context while continuing to use\\nfixed-context models. Our approach borrows from the idea of virtual memory paging that was\\ndeveloped to enable applications to work on datasets that far exceed the available memory. We\\nleverage the recent progress in function calling abilities of LLM agents (Schick et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\\n2023b) to design MemGPT, an OS-inspired LLM system for virtual context management . We\\ndraw inspiration from traditional OSes’ hierarchical memory management to effectively “page” in\\n1arXiv:2310.08560v1  [cs.AI]  12 Oct 2023Preprint\\nLLM processorParserVirtual contextExternal context∞ tokensMain contextMax token limitYieldEventMessage🧑Document upload📄System message🔔FunctionRead memorySend message📣…ParserTimer⏱…Pause interrupts🔕Write memory\\nFigure 1: In MemGPT (components shaded), a fixed-context LLM is augmented with a hierarchical\\nmemory system and functions that let it manage its own memory. The LLM processor takes main\\ncontext (analogous to OS main memory/RAM) as input, and outputs text interpreted by a parser,\\nresulting either in a yield or a function call. MemGPT uses functions to move data between main\\ncontext and external context (analogous to OS disk memory). When the processor generates a\\nfunction call, it can request control ahead of time to chain together functions. When yielding, the\\nprocessor is paused until the next external event (e.g., a user message or scheduled interrupt).\\nand out information between context windows (analogous to “main memory” in operating systems)\\nand external storage. MemGPT manages the control flow between the memory management, the\\nLLM processing module, and user. This design allows for repeated context modifications during a\\nsingle task, allowing the agent to more effectively utilize its limited context.\\nIn MemGPT, we treat context windows as a constrained memory resource, and design a memory\\nhiearchy for LLMs analogous to memory tiers used in traditional OSes (Patterson et al., 1988).\\nApplications in traditional OSes interact with virtual memory , which provides an illusion of there\\nbeing more memory resources than are actually available in physical (i.e., main) memory by the OS\\npaging overflow data to disk and retrieving data (via a page fault) back into memory when accessed\\nby applications. To provide a similar illusion of longer context length (analogous to virtual memory),\\nwe allow the LLM to manage what is placed in its own context (analogous to physical memory) via\\nan ‘LLM OS’, which we call MemGPT. MemGPT enables the LLM to retrieve relevant historical\\ndata missing from what is placed in-context, similar to an OS page fault. Additionally, the agent can\\niteratively modify what is in context for a single task, in the same way a process may access virtual\\nmemory repeatedly. Figure 1 illustrates the components of MemGPT.\\nThe combined use of a memory-hierarchy, OS functions and event-based control flow allow\\nMemGPT to handle unbounded context using LLMs that have finite context windows. To demon-\\nstrate the utility of our new OS-inspired LLM system, we evaluate MemGPT on two domains where\\nthe performance of existing LLMs is severely limited by finite context: document analysis, where the\\nlength of standard text files can quickly exceed the input capacity of modern LLMs, and conversa-\\ntional agents, where LLMs bound by limited conversation windows lack context awareness, persona\\nconsistency, and long-term memory during extended conversations. In both settings, MemGPT is\\nable to overcome the limitations of finite context to outperform existing LLM-based approaches.\\n2 M EMORY -GPT (M EMGPT)\\nIn this section, we outline the implementation of MemGPT, an OS-inspired LLM system that teaches\\nLLMs to manage their own memory to achieve unbounded context. MemGPT’s multi-level mem-\\nory architecture delineates between two primary memory types: main context (analogous to main\\nmemory/physical memory/RAM) and external context (analogous to disk memory/disk storage).\\nMain context is the standard fixed-context window in modern language models—anything in main\\ncontext is considered in-context and can be accessed by the LLM processor during inference. Ex-\\nternal context refers to any information that is held outside of the LLMs fixed context window. This\\nout-of-context data must always be explicitly moved into main context in order for it to be passed to\\n2Preprint\\nTable 1: Comparing context lengths of commonly used models / APIs (data collected 9/2023).\\n*Assuming a preprompt of 1k tokens, and an average message size of ∼50 tokens ( ∼250 characters).\\nModel / API designation Availability Max Tokens Max conversation length*\\nllama-1 model family Open source 2k tokens 20 total messages\\nllama-2 model family Open source 4k tokens 60 total messages\\ngpt-3.5-turbo API 4k tokens 60 total messages\\ngpt-4 API 8k tokens 140 total messages\\ngpt-3.5-turbo-16k API 16k tokens 300 total messages\\ngpt-4-32k Limited API 32k tokens ∼600 total messages\\nclaude-instant-1 Limited API 100k tokens ∼2000 total messages\\nclaude-2 Limited API 100k tokens ∼2000 total messages\\nthe LLM processor during inference. MemGPT provides function calls that the LLM processor can\\nuse to manage its own memory without any user intervention.\\n2.1 M AIN CONTEXT\\nIn MemGPT we refer to the LLM inputs (that are bound by the maximum number of input tokens)\\nas the system’s main context. In LLM-based conversational agents, a significant portion of main\\ncontext tokens is generally used to hold a ‘system message’ or ‘preprompt’ that dictates the nature\\nof the interaction to the system, while the remainder of the tokens can be used to hold conversation\\ndata (Touvron et al., 2023; SillyTavern, 2023). This preprompt is the main way to enable the system\\nto adopt various distinct personas without requiring finetuning of the base model; depending on\\nthe use case, the preprompt can range from basic primers (e.g., ‘You are a helpful assistant.’) to\\ncomplex instructions comprising of thousands of tokens (e.g., a fictional character card that includes\\nthe character’s background and example dialogue). Beyond conversational agents, large preprompts\\nare also common when LLMs are used to solve complex tasks that require long instructions and/or\\ninstructions with many in-context examples (Liu et al., 2023b).\\nBecause of the importance of the preprompt in dictating system behavior, it is common for the pre-\\nprompt to consume more than a thousand tokens, which means the entire context window in many\\nmodern LLMs will be exhausted only with a few dozen back-and-forth messages between the user\\nand system. For example, a 1000 token preprompt (roughly the size of the MemGPT preprompt in\\nour experiments) leaves space for only about 60 remaining messages when using 4K context models\\nsuch as llama-2 orgpt-3.5-turbo (see Table 1 for more examples). In settings where the\\nuser is expected to communicate frequently with the system (for example, virtual companions or\\npersonalized assistants), it is easy to imagine exceeding the maximum conversation length even for\\nmodels with 100k context windows in a matter of days (or potentially hours). Resursive summariza-\\ntion (Wu et al., 2021b) is a simple way to address overflowing context windows, however, recursive\\nsummarization is inherently lossy and eventually leads to large holes in the memory of the system\\n(as we demonstrate in Section 3). This motivates the need for a more comprehensive way to manage\\nmemory for conversational systems that are meant to be used in long-term settings.\\nIn our experiments on multi-session chat and document analysis, we further divide main context\\ninto three components: system instructions , which hold the base LLM instructions (e.g., informa-\\ntion describing MemGPT functions and control flow to the LLM), conversational context , which\\nholds a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue of recent event history (e.g., messages between the agent and\\nuser), and working context , which serves as a working memory scratchpad for the agent. System\\ninstructions are read-only and pinned to main context (they do not change during the lifetime of the\\nMemGPT agent), conversational context is read-only with a special eviction policy (if the queue\\nreaches a certain size, a portion of the front is truncated or compressed via recursive summariza-\\ntion), and working context is writeable by the LLM processor via function calls. Combined, the\\nthree parts of main context cannot exceed the underlying LLM processors’s maximum context size,\\nand in practice we limit the size of conversational context and working context to a fixed constant\\ndetermined by the processor’s context window and the system instructions length.\\n3Preprint\\nHello Chad, welcome!

Information in external context is\\nnot immediately visible to the LLM processor, however, it can be brought into main context through\\nappropriate function calls. In practice, the underlying storage in external context can take various\\nforms which can be configured for specific tasks: for example, for conversational agents it may be\\ndesireable to store full chat logs between the user and agent (that MemGPT can access at a later\\ndate), and for document analysis large document collections can be stored inside external context\\nthat MemGPT can bring into restricted main context via paginated function calls to disk.\\nIn our experiments, using MemGPT for multi-session chat and document analysis, we use databases\\nto store text documents and embeddings/vectors, provide several ways for the LLM processor to\\nquery external context: timestamp-based search, text-based search, and embedding-based search.\\nWe make a distinction between two types of external context: recall storage , which stores the entire\\nhistory of events processed by the LLM processor (in essense the full uncompressed queue from\\nactive memory), and archival storage , which serves as a general read-write datastore that the agent\\ncan utilize as overflow for the in-context read-write core memory. In the context of conversational\\nagents, archival storage allows MemGPT to store facts, experiences, preferences, etc. about the\\nagent or user beyond the strict token limit of main context, and search over recall storage allows\\nthe MemGPT to find past interactions related to a particular query or within a specific time period.\\nIn the context of document analysis, archival storage can be used to search over (and add to) an\\nexpansive document database.\\n2.3 S ELF-DIRECTED EDITING AND RETRIEVAL\\nMemGPT orchestrates data movement between main context and external context via function calls\\nthat are generated by the LLM processor. Memory edits and retrieval are entirely self-directed:\\nMemGPT autonomously updates and searches through its own memory based on the current con-\\ntext. For instance, it can decide when to move items between contexts (Figure 2) and modify its\\nmain context to better reflect its evolving understanding of its current objectives and responsibilities\\n(Figure 4). We implement self-directed editing and retrieval by providing explicit instructions within\\nthe preprompt that guide the system on how to interact with its memory systems. These instructions\\ncomprise two main components: (1) a detailed description of the memory hierarchy and their re-\\nspective utilities, and (2) a function schema (complete with their natural language descriptions) that\\nthe system can call to access or modify its memory.\\n4Preprint\\nHello Chad!
